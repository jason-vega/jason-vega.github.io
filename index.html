            Hi there! I'm a first-year computer science Ph.D. student at the 
            <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> 
            working on artificial intelligence research. Currently, I'm exploring topics 
            related to trustworthy machine learning, namely robustness to distribution 
            shift with <a href="https://ggndpsngh.github.io">Prof. Gagandeep Singh</a> 
            as well as machine unlearning and fairness in federated learning with
            <a href="https://aisecure.github.io">Prof. Bo Li</a>.
            <br>
