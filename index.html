        Hi there! I'm a first year computer science Ph.D. student at the 
        University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign working on artificial 
        intelligence research. Currently, I'm working on projects related 
        to trustworthy machine learning, namely robustness to distribution 
        shift and fairness in federated learning.
