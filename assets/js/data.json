  "bio" : "Hey there! I'm Jason, a second year undergraduate at UC San Diego majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics. My interests lie in the field of artificial intelligence, effective team management and computer science education.<br><br>As a part of the <a href=\"http://ersp.ucsd.edu/index.php/about/\">Early Research Scholars Program</a> at UCSD, I'm currently involved in digital humanities research under <a href=\"http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/\">Professor Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick</a>, working to develop fast line extraction algorithms for historical printed documents from the early modern period (1500-1800 AD). Additionally, during the summer of 2020, I will be interning at Microsoft as a part of their <a href=\"https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/usexploremicrosoftprogram\">Explore Microsoft</a> internship program.<br><br>I look to the future with optimism, and hope to one day become a leader in developing more capable artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity.",
