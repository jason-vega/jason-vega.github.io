  "bio" : "Hey there! I'm Jason, a third-year UCSD computer science major from the Bay Area. I am currently a <a href=\"https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/research-programs/mcnair/index.html\">UCSD McNair scholar</a> for the 2020-2021 academic year, and am very fortunate to be advised by UCSD HDSI Prof. Lily Weng. As an undergraduate researcher, my goal is to help make AI more accessible, capable, and transparent for interdisciplinary research in academia and applications in industry. Specifically, I am interested in designing and passing sanity checks for current AI methods and models with the goal of producing more human-oriented AI (e.g. better interpretability and improved robustness). During the academic year, I help UCSD CSE Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick lead a team of four <a href=\"https://ersp.eng.ucsd.edu/\">CSE Early Research Scholars Program</a> participants, working on improving text line segmentation methods for machine-printed historical documents. Additionally, for my McNair project with Prof. Lily Weng, I am conducting research on improving the interpretability robustness of CNNs for post-hoc interpretability methods.",
